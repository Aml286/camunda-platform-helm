You can consume each individual chart, or use the `zeebe-full-helm` chart which will install all the components, including an NGINX Ingress Controller.

What is inside the helm repo check the [index.yaml](https://helm.camunda.io/index.yaml) or the [github repository](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-cloud-helm).

Follow [the instructions in the Zeebe docs](https://docs.zeebe.io/kubernetes/installing-helm.html) to install Zeebe to a K8s cluster using these charts.

Each Chart contains it's own configurations and parameters, you can visit each chart README for more information. 

**Note check the [Zeebe Helm Profiles](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-helm-profiles) repository for different configurations for your clusters, such as Dev, HA, etc. Feel free to contribute with your own profiles if you want to**

## Installing Charts

You can install these Helm Charts by running:
```
helm install <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME> zeebe/zeebe-full-helm
```
This command will install all Zeebe Components that are provided by the `zeebe-full-helm` chart.


## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:
```
helm uninstall <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME>
```

> Notice that all the services and pods will be deleted, but not the Persistence Volume Claims which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and ElasticSearch. In order to free up the storage you need to manually delete all the Persistent Volume Claims. You can do this by running:
```
kubectl get pvc
```
Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:
```
kubectl delete pvc <PVC ids here>
```

Or delete the related kubernetes namespace, which contains the resources.
